# SpearpointGalaxy
 A videogame project I did back in High School. A "Galaga" wannabe.
 
#Overview
Briefly introduce your project. Explain its purpose, inspiration, and any unique features or goals.
Videogame project I did back in High School, year 2021/2022. Even though it's a really bad-designed game, it was my first time projecting and building a game all by myself. Why publish it this after 2 years? Because I wanted to build my portfolio. 
SpearpointGalaxy is "Galaga" based game where you control a spaceship and try to survive enemy waves. More time you survive, more points you get.
